# 1) Create a tuple `weather` containing 7 values (one for each day of the week).
#    Here, 1 represents sunny weather and 0 represents rainy weather.

# 2) Initialize two counters:
#    a) `sunny = 0` to count sunny days
#    b) `rainy = 0` to count rainy days

# 3) Use a `for` loop to iterate through the 7 days (index 0 to 6):
#    a) Check the value at `weather[i]`
#    b) If it is 0, increase `rainy` by 1
#    c) Otherwise, increase `sunny` by 1

# 4) After counting, compare the number of sunny days and rainy days:
#    a) If `sunny > rainy`, print "Good weather"
#    b) Else, print "Bad weather"
