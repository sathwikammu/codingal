# 1) Define a function `match_words(words)` that takes a list of words as input.

# 2) Inside the function, initialize:
#    a) `ctr = 0` to count how many words match the condition.
#    b) `lst = []` to store the words whose first and last characters are the same.

# 3) Use a `for` loop to iterate through each `word` in the input list `words`.

# 4) For each word, check the condition:
#    a) The length of the word should be greater than 1 (`len(word) > 1`).
#    b) The first character `word[0]` should be equal to the last character `word[-1]`.

# 5) If the condition is true:
#    a) Increase the counter `ctr` by 1.
#    b) Add the word to the list `lst` using `lst.append(word)`.

# 6) After checking all words, print the list of matching words.

# 7) Return the final count `ctr`.

# 8) Call the function `match_words(...)` with a sample list of words
#    and store the returned value in `count`.

# 9) Print the total number of words whose first and last characters are the same.
