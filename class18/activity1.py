# 1) Import the `random` module to generate random numbers.

# 2) Create a variable `playing = True` to control the game loop.

# 3) Generate a random number between 0 and 9 using `random.randint(0, 9)`
#    and convert it to a string, then store it in `number`.
#    (This is the secret number the user must guess.)

# 4) Print instructions explaining the guessing game.

# 5) Start a `while` loop that runs as long as `playing` is True:
#    a) Take a guess from the user and store it in `guess`.

# 6) Check if the user's guess matches the secret number:
#    a) If `number == guess`:
#       i) Print a winning message.
#       ii) Display the secret number.
#       iii) Stop the loop using `break` (game ends).

# 7) Otherwise (if the guess is incorrect):
#    a) Print a message telling the user to try again.
#    b) The loop continues and asks for another guess.
